## Introduction

This code demonstrates an autonomous robot's behavior through a series of states, each representing a different action or behavior. The robot's movements are controlled based on sensor inputs, and it transitions between states according to certain conditions.

## Code Overview

The main functionalities of this autonomous robot control code include:

- Reading sensors such as photodiodes (PD), bumper switches, and limit switches.
- Implementing movement logic for different states, including spinning, forward motion, and stopping.
- Executing specific actions based on sensor readings, such as responding to bumper collisions or reaching a limit switch.

Please note that the provided code snippet lacks some context, variable definitions, and function implementations. The code snippet might need adjustments and additional implementations to work effectively.

## Prerequisites

- Robot hardware equipped with the necessary sensors (photodiodes, bumper switches, limit switches).
- Microcontroller or development board compatible with the code (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi).
- C/C++ compiler and development environment.
- Motor drivers or other relevant hardware components for controlling robot movements.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the main code file (e.g., `Main.cpp`) in your preferred C/C++ development environment.
3. Make sure you have the required libraries or dependencies installed if any are used (not provided in the provided code snippet).
4. Compile and upload the code to your robot's microcontroller or development board.

## Contributing

Contributions to improve and expand this example code are welcome! If you find issues or want to enhance the code, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
